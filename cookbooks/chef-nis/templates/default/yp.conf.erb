#
# yp.conf Configuration file for the ypbind process. You can define
#   NIS servers manually here if they can't be found by
#   broadcasting on the local net (which is the default).
#
#   See the manual page of ypbind for the syntax of this file.
#
# IMPORTANT:  For the "ypserver", use IP addresses, or make sure that
#   the host is in /etc/hosts. This file is only interpreted
#   once, and if DNS isn't reachable yet the ypserver cannot
#   be resolved and ypbind won't ever bind to the server.
#
# Note: This file is managed by Chef.  Local modifications will be OVERWRITTEN
#       on the next invocation of the Chef client.
